# 🌐 Woodie Labs

**Woodie Labs** is a collection of small but useful web-based tools and experiments.  
We build utilities that make developers’ lives easier and provide handy features for everyday use.  
From formatting JSON to generating colors or testing APIs, our goal is to turn **small ideas into practical tools**.

- 🌙 **Developer-Friendly**: Dark mode, keyboard shortcuts, and clean layouts.
- 🔬 **Experimental**: A playground for trying new ideas and side projects.
